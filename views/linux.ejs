                <h2>History of Linux</h2>
                <p>Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as an open-source operating system kernel. Torvalds originally developed Linux as a personal project to create a free alternative to the proprietary UNIX system. He wanted to build a flexible and customizable OS that could run on a variety of hardware platforms.</p>
                <p>The first version of Linux was released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which encouraged collaboration and modifications by developers worldwide. This sparked the growth of a vibrant open-source community, with developers contributing to the Linux kernel and building various distributions, or "distros," tailored to different needs. Popular distros today include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.</p>
                <p>Over the years, Linux has evolved significantly, becoming the backbone of many systems, from web servers and supercomputers to smartphones and embedded devices. Today, Linux is one of the most widely used operating systems globally, especially in enterprise environments and cloud computing.</p>
