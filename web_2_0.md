# Web 2.0: The Dynamic and Social Web

The advent of Web 2.0 in the early 2000s marked a shift from static content to dynamic, user-generated content. This era saw the rise of social media, online collaboration, and rich internet applications, transforming the web into an interactive platform.

## Google Search - PageRank Algorithm
Google revolutionized search with its PageRank algorithm, which evaluated the quality and quantity of links to a page as a measure of its relevance. This innovation, developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, made Google the most popular search engine by providing more accurate and reliable results. Launched in 1998, Google quickly became a dominant player, setting the standard for information retrieval and helping users navigate the ever-expanding web with ease.

## Roy Fielding - REST
In his 2000 dissertation, Roy Fielding introduced the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, which became the foundation for web services and APIs. REST provided a framework for client-server communication that was both scalable and flexible, allowing different systems to interact seamlessly. By defining a set of constraints and leveraging HTTP methods, REST enabled developers to build web services that could easily integrate with other applications. Today, RESTful APIs are ubiquitous, facilitating the interconnectedness of modern web services.

## Ryan Dahl - Node.js / JavaScript
Node.js, created by Ryan Dahl in 2009, extended JavaScript to the server side, enabling developers to use a single language for both client and server. This shift allowed for more efficient development and the creation of real-time, scalable applications. Node.js is based on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it ideal for handling concurrent connections. The rise of Node.js solidified JavaScript’s role as a full-stack language, further blurring the lines between front-end and back-end development.

## Python - Guido van Rossum
Python, created by Guido van Rossum, gained widespread adoption in Web 2.0 due to its readability, versatility, and ease of use. Python’s simplicity made it a favorite for web development, with frameworks like Django and Flask streamlining the process of building robust web applications. Beyond web development, Python found applications in data analysis, machine learning, and automation, making it one of the most popular programming languages of the Web 2.0 era and beyond.

## Git - Linus Torvalds
Linus Torvalds developed Git in 2005 as a distributed version control system to manage the Linux kernel’s development. Git’s design allowed developers to work on code simultaneously, tracking changes and merging contributions from multiple sources. Its distributed nature ensured that each contributor had a complete copy of the repository, making it resilient and collaborative. Git became essential to modern software development, powering platforms like GitHub, which facilitate open-source projects and version-controlled codebases for developers worldwide.
