# Web 1.0: The Static Web

With the advent of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s, the internet transformed from a research tool into a global platform for information sharing. This era, known as Web 1.0, was characterized by static content, accessible through early browsers. The focus was on creating and sharing documents rather than interactivity or user-generated content.

## HTML and HTTP Protocol - Tim Berners-Lee
In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, invented HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). HTML allowed documents to be structured with headings, paragraphs, links, and images, enabling the creation of web pages. HTTP facilitated the transfer of these documents across the internet, allowing users to access them through a web browser. The first website went live in 1991, and these technologies laid the foundation for the web as we know it, making it accessible to the public for the first time.

## JavaScript
JavaScript, developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, introduced interactivity to the otherwise static web. By allowing scripts to run directly in the browser, JavaScript enabled dynamic content that responded to user actions without needing to refresh the page. This marked a significant advancement, as websites could now offer a more engaging user experience. JavaScript became a cornerstone of web development, setting the stage for more complex client-side applications.

## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), introduced by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos in 1996, provided a way to separate a web page's content from its design. With CSS, developers could control the layout, colors, and fonts of a website independently of the HTML. This separation allowed for greater flexibility and consistency in design, as changes could be made across multiple pages without altering the content. CSS became essential for web design, allowing for the creation of visually appealing and responsive websites.

## Perl and PHP Server Technologies
Perl and PHP were instrumental in developing dynamic web content. Perl, popular in the early 1990s, was widely used for CGI scripts, enabling server-side processing. PHP, introduced in 1995, quickly gained popularity due to its simplicity and ability to embed directly within HTML. Both languages allowed for interactive websites, where content could be generated dynamically based on user input or other factors. This was a major step toward the interactive web applications that would later characterize Web 2.0.

## Linux - Linus Torvalds
Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer scientist, released Linux in 1991 as a free, open-source operating system. Due to its flexibility, security, and low cost, Linux became the preferred operating system for web servers. As the web grew, Linux provided the backbone for many of the servers that hosted websites and managed internet traffic. Its open-source nature also fostered a collaborative development environment, making it adaptable to various uses and widely supported by the tech community.

## Early Search Engines - AltaVista and HotBot
As the World Wide Web expanded, the need for search engines became evident. AltaVista, launched in 1995, was one of the first search engines to provide a comprehensive index of web content, allowing users to find information quickly and efficiently. HotBot, introduced in 1996, offered similar capabilities, with additional features like Boolean search operators. These early search engines made it easier for users to navigate the vast information available online, paving the way for the more sophisticated search technologies that followed.
