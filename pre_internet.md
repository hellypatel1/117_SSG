# Pre-Internet: Foundations of Networked Computing

The internet's foundation lies in the visions and efforts of early computer scientists, driven by geopolitical factors and government initiatives. Key figures like J.C.R. Licklider and projects funded by ARPA laid the groundwork for what would eventually become the internet. This period was marked by theoretical developments that would later shape networked computing as we know it today.

## JC Licklider
J.C.R. Licklider, a psychologist and computer scientist, was one of the first to envision a globally connected network of computers. Working at ARPA in the early 1960s, he proposed the idea of an "Intergalactic Computer Network," where computers would facilitate communication and collaboration across vast distances. Licklider's vision emphasized human-computer interaction, seeing a future where people could access information and communicate seamlessly. He advocated for ARPA to invest in networking research, setting in motion the projects that would eventually lead to ARPANET.

## Nuclear Weapons and Cold War Influence
The Cold War era profoundly impacted technological research and development. The possibility of nuclear war necessitated communication systems that could withstand catastrophic attacks. This led to the exploration of decentralized networks, which could operate even if parts of the network were destroyed. The concept of packet switching emerged as a solution, where data would be divided into packets and routed through various paths, making communication more resilient. These principles became the foundation for the development of ARPANET and eventually the internet.

## ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency)
Founded in 1958 in response to the Soviet Union’s advancements, ARPA (later renamed DARPA) was tasked with maintaining U.S. technological superiority. ARPA funded groundbreaking research in networking technologies, most notably ARPANET. The agency’s emphasis on decentralized communication and innovative technologies allowed for significant advancements, including the early exploration of packet-switching networks. ARPA’s role in pioneering this research established a pathway that directly led to the birth of the internet, influencing not only military but also academic and commercial sectors.
